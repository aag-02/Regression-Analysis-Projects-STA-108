# Regression-Analysis-Projects-STA-108

The report should begin with a brief introduction (about half a page), followed by
the parts listed below.

### Part I: Fitting regression models. 
Refer to the CDI data set in Appendix C.2. The number of active physicians in a CDI (Y) is expected to be related to total population, number of hospital beds, and total personal income. Assume that first-order regression model (1.1) is appropriate for each of the three predictor variables.
a. Regress the number of active physicians in turn on each of the three predictor variables.
State the estimated regression functions.
b. Plot the three estimated regression functions and data on separate graphs. Does a linear
regression relation appear to provide a good fit for each of the three predictor variables?
c. Calculate MSE for each of the three predictor variables. Which predictor variable leads to
the smallest variability around the fitted regression line?

### Part II: Measuring linear associations. 
Refer to the CDI data set in Appendix C.2 and Project l.43. Using R2 as the criterion, which predictor variable accounts for the largest reduction in the variability in the number of active physicians?

### Part III. Inference about regression parameters. 
Refer to the CDI data set in Appendix C.2 and Project l.44. Obtain a separate interval estimate of B1, for each region. Use a 90 percent confidence coefficient in each case. Do the regression lines for the different regions appear to have similar slopes? Also carry out the analysis of variance (ANOVA) for each regression model and state the results of the F-tests. What do you conclude in each case?

### Part IV: Regression diagnostics.
Refer to the CDI data set in Appendix C.2 and Project 1.43. For each ofthe three fitted regression models, obtain the residuals and prepare a residual plot against X and a normal probability plot. Summarize your conclusions. Is linear regression model (2.1) more appropriate in one case than in the others?

### Part V: Discussion. 
Discuss the possible impact of observational data on your results. Are there any thing else that you would like to comment on? Any suggestions on how to improve the linear regression models?
