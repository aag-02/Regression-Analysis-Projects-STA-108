# Regression-Analysis-Projects-STA-108

Backgroud. The CDI data is described on pages 1349 and 1350 of the book.
• Requirements:
1. You are encouraged to work in small groups with 2-3 people in each group. Each
group will submit one report, with the names of the group members on the front page.
2. The report should begin with a brief introduction (about half a page), followed by
the parts listed below.
3. The due date of the project is Monday, Feb. 7, 2022, by midnight on canvas.
• Data: Available at the Smartsite, or on CD attached to the book.
• The project has five parts:
Part I: Fitting regression models. This part consists of Project 1.43 of the book. Note
that there are three parts (a, b, c) in this project.
Part II: Measuring linear associations. Project 2.62 in the book.
Part III. Inference about regression parameters. Project 2.63 in the book. Also carry
out the analysis of variance (ANOVA) for each regression model and state the results
of the F-tests. What do you conclude in each case?
Part IV: Regression diagnostics. Project 3.25 in the book.
Part V: Discussion. Discuss the possible impact of observational data on your results.
Are there any thing else that you would like to comment on? Any suggestions on how
to improve the linear regression models?
